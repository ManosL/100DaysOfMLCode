# 100DaysOfMLCode

# Introduction

In this repository there will be my code and progress 
into the 100DaysofMLCode Challenge which I started from
this day of 17th December of 2020. I will also write about
my progress into my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmmanuelLykos) account

# Progress

## Day 1

I set a goal to learn to make myself familiar with PyTorch
framework after I learned Keras, so today I made myself 
familiar with tensor handling, I implemented R-Squared using tensors
and I took a look at creating a simple neural network through the 
60-Minute Blitz.

## Day 2

I continued  PyTorch 60-Minute Blitz and I finally implemented 
the CIFAR10 classifier(with 50% accuracy) and an MNIST 
Classifier(around 97% accuracy) using ConvNets. Moreover, 
I created my own transform.
